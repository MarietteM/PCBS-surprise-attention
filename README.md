# PCBS-surprise-attention
Projet PCBS/ AE

The current project is based on the work of Gernot Horstmann(2014). The study investigates the surprise attention hypothesis, which postulates that unexpected events induce surprise in subjects, which in turn elicits attention towards this surprising event.
